Cost FUnction FOr optimizing Motor's speed , it has 3 examples : single speed , multispeed and fuzzy

Problem 1 : simple problem , by optimizing simple PID to DC motor

Problem 2 : this time is variant speed , so I used PID2DOF controller

problem 3 : I did the coding to optimize FUZZY LOGIC controller
all by my hand
